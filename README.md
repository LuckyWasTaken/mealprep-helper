## DEPRECATED! 


Just a simple angular App to keep track of your shopping list for your [mealprepsunday](http://reddit.com/r/mealprepsunday)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deployment 

Build with `npm run webpack:server`
Ship dist folder to server and execute ./server.js
